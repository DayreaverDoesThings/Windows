This project contains various batch files for Windows that I use on some of my deployed systems. I try to keep batch files as-simple as possible and focused on a specific task, instead of presenting a massive script file with user-input. KISS (the acronym) :p

I have individual batch files and contents on my Gist here: https://gist.github.com/Espionage724/7d0cdd8c2ac09ec7cdfab85d62ff49e6
